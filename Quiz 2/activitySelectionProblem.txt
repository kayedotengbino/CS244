ALGO DESIGN TECHNIQUE
    GREEDY ALGO
        approach has a few trade-offs
        suitable for optimization 
    STANDARD ALGO FOR GREEDY ALGO
        Kruskal's min spanning tree  
            find the min spanning forest of an undirected graph
        Djikstras shortest path
            findintg the shortest path of node in a graph
        Prims min spanning tree
            fin the min spanning  tree for weighted & directed graph
        Huffman Coding
            optimal prefix cde that is commonly uised for loseless data 
                compression

PROCESS
    STEPS - using greedy algo
        1: sort the activities according to ther finishing time
        2: Select the 1st activity frm the sorted array and print it
        3: Do the following for the remaining activities in the sorted array
            If start time of this activity >= finishing tome of the 
                previously selected activity
                selct this activity and print it

ADVANTAGES OF USING GREEDY ALGO IN ASP
    Analyzing the running time for greedy algo will generally be much
        easier than for other techniques

DISADVANTAGES
    not all greedy algo are correct and safe
    hard to prove why it is correct

RUNNING TIME
    O(n); n = number of uactivities
    O(nlogn); sorting
