Flow Network
    directed graph G written as G(V, E) that have a source S & a sink T 
    TIME COMPLEXITY
        O(e*f); e = all edges, f = max flow
    Algorithm Design 
        Ford-Fulkerson - greedy algorithm

Augmented graph
    making data flow through the edges
    METHOD
        non-full forward edges
            flow has not reach the capacity
        non-empty backward edges
            follows the flow shown in the graph

Bottleneck capacity
    highest capacity the flow coud carry to the sink
