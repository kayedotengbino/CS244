Chromatic number   
    smallest number of colors needed to color a graph G

Cycle graph
    Even Cycle - even number of vertices (requires 2 color)
    Odd Cycle - odd number of vertices (requires 3 color)

Basic Greedy Algorithm
    never uses more than d+1; d: maximum degree of a vertex in a given graph
    PROCESS
    1: Arrange the vertices of the graph in some order
    2: Color first vertex with first color
    3: Do the following for remaining v-1 vertices
        a: consider the currently picked vertex and color it with the lowest
            numbered color that has not been used on any previously colored 
            vertices adj to it. 
            If all previously used colors appear on vertices adj to picked 
                vertix
                then assign a new color to it
    Time Complexity - O(V^2 + E) worst case
                    - O(n^2)

Planar graph
    not more than 4 colors due to 4-color theorem
