B Tree
    invented with Rudolft Bayer and Ed McCreight in 1972
    self balancing search tree in which each node can contain more than one key
      and can have more than 2 Children
    Generalized form of BST
    Height-balanced m-way tree

Tree
    Hierarchal data structure for storage and retieval of data
    non-linear data structure

M
    a number of pointer a single mode could have

PROPERTIES
    every node has at most m children
    a non-lead node h children if it is met a leaf node
    every non-leaf node, except the root, have at least m/2 children (ceil)
    all leaves appear in the same level

TIME COMPLEXITY
    O(log N) for all because stable
        n = total number of elem in b-tree
