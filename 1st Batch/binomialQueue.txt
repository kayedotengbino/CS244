    Binomial Queue
        invented by Jean Vuillemin in 1978
        extension of binary heap that provides faster range of operations together with
          other operations provided by binary heap
        consists of collection of binomial tree that satisfies the binary heap property
          and one tree of each degree
        PROPERTIES
            Its key is contained in Bsub0 to Bsubk
            has at most floor O(log2n)
            longest tree is floor O(log2n)
        RUNNING time
            O(log N) for all operations - stable

    Jean Vuillemin
        british computer scientist in data structure
        aimed for a logarithmic time for all operations of priority queues and binary Heap

    Binomial Tree
        ordered Tree
        follows the property of min-heap in data structure
        PROPERTIES
            Binomial Tree of k degree, the root has k childre
            Binomial tree elements is 2^k
            Binomial tree height is k
            Children of the root are Binomial tree of degree k-1...0

    Min-Heap    
        parents node > child nodes

    Relationship of Binomial Queue and Binary System
        Binomial queue with n nodes has the number of binomial tree = number of setbits in the binary
        representation

    Algorithm Design Technique used
        Collection of Binomial Tree's
        min heap order
        must not have 1 tree of the same height
        implement trees using leftto right sibling

    Application
        extension of binary heap
        have the operations provided by the binary heap
        provides faster range of operations by O(logN) for Binomial Queue and O(n) for binary Heap
